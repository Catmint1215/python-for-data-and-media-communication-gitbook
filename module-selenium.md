# Selenium

Selenium module can be used in dynamic page web scraping on Windows Systems. It supports Firefox, IE, Chrome and Remote.

## Basic steps

### Step 1 install selenium

pip install selenium

### Step 2 install webdriver and put it in the project's working directory

For example, I use Chrome, so I need download a ChromeDriver. Download linkï¼š
https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home

### Step 3 start from opening a dynamic page web url

```python
browser = webdriver.Chrome()
browser.get('http://money.cnn.com/search/index.html?sortBy=date&primaryType=mixed&search=Search&query=trade%20war')
time.sleep(10)
```

For detailed use, refer to the Selenium documentation:

## Chrome driver not found in path error

>Message: 'chromedriver' executable needs to be in PATH

This is common error. You can download [Chrome Driver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home) and put it in your [Current Working Folder](shell.md#verify-your-current-working-folder). Note, for venv and jupyter user, this is not your project root folder, or the venv folder. It is the path at which you issued the `jupyter notebook` command -- a.k.a. "current working folder".

MAC user has a shortcut to install chromedriver in the path.

```shell
brew cask install chromedriver
```

## Find elements by Xpath

For `XPath` method, XPath uses path expressions to select nodes or node-sets in an XML document. The following are basic expression rules and expression path examples. For a more detailed usage, you can check out this [tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp).

Basic expression rules:

| Expression | Description                                                                                           |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /          | Selects from the root node                                                                            |
| //         | Selects nodes in the document from the current node that match the selection no matter where they are |
| .          | Selects the parent of the current node                                                                |
| @          | Selects attributes                                                                                    |

Path Expression examples:

| Path Expression     | Results                                                                          |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /bookstore/book[1]  | Selects the first book element that is the child of the bookstore element.       |
| //book              | Selects all book elements no matter where they are in the document               |
| //@lang             | Selects all attributes that are named lang                                       |
| //title[@lang='en'] | Selects all the title elements that have a "lang" attribute with a value of "en" |

## Find elements by css selector

When we use the find elements in css selector. Two common error are that:

1. the element cannot be located.
2. matching imprecisely. We can find the element, but thats not what we want.

The following are useful workflow that can help us debug when encounter those problems:

1. CSS Selector needs to be precise some time. Being too broad may risk matching something else.
2. The best practice is to use select_elements_x method (notice s) first to verify if the matching is precise. If it is, use the non-"s" version to find the element. If it is not, check if the elements come in specific order. If so, one can use list navigation to locate the precise one.
