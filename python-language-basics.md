# Python Language Basics

## Syntax

### Blanks

code "print \(\)", then execute

### Double quotes and single quotes

double quotes equal to single quotes

### \[\] does not work to specify precedence in formula

\(\) is used to specify precedence in formula rather than \[\]

For example, \(\(1+r\)\*n-1\) can be executed, but \[\(1+r\)\*n-1\] can not be executed.

\[\] have other function, like `range\[1:50\]`

### Multiplication operator `*` can not be omitted in formula

Take an example:

when we exercise the mortgage calculator: `A=P*r*(1+r)`  
is different from `A=Pr\(1+r\)`, the latter one can not be executed.

### Where need to be bracket? Where need to be quotation mark?

Bracket is a function quote \(e.g print \(\) \); quotation mark is used to quote the string

### Small p is different from capital P

```bash
p = 1
print(P)
```

You will see the error message `NameError: name 'P' is not defined` . That is because Python is **case-sensitive. **The lowercase `p` and uppercase `P` mean different variables.

### \(\) close to the range in the left, open the range in the right

```python
For i in range(1,10):
    print (i)
```

You will see the outcome: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 without 10, because the left range is included, while the right range is excluded.

### == and =

In python, notation `==` represents making a judgment / comparison. Notation `=` means assign values.

For example:

```python
df['location'] == '旺角'
#this means Iterate all elements in location column to compare whether its equal to 旺角
df['location'] = '旺角'
#this means assign 旺角 to every element in the column location
```
