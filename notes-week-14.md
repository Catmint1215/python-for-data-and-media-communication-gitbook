# Week 14: High Dimensional Data

## Recap of data points and variables

Two flavours of data:

- Social science research, e.g. survey data: many variable; a few data points
- Big data, e.g. user behaviour, server log: many data points; a few variables
  - Some may also get "many variables" but those many variables are usually of the same nature

## Measure the similarity between data points

- inner product
- cosine
- set intersection
- ...

## Dimensionality Reduction

### Principal Component Analysis

### Graph Laplacian methods (Spectral Embedding)

### Other non-linear methods

- t-SNE
- LLE
